Motivation:
With the development of hardware technology, people can get affordable depth scanner, such as Kinect. I write this software to help me get the depth data by applying Kinect. This is just a start up, I have a strong interest in 3d related technology, such as 3d modeling, 3d interaction. I will implement ideas based on this software. 

If you have any questions and advices about this software, or you want to join to design the software together, please feel free to contact magic3d.cn@gmail.com or magic3d@163.com. 

In the software, I use several resources:

FLANN: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/
MyGUI: http://mygui.info/
